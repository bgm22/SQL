I used a Kaggle SQL Database called "Spotifydata" to look at different factors for the Top 50 songs of the year.  

#1 - What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT avg(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#2 - Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3 - What artist released the longest song?

SELECT MAX(duration_ms), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#4 - What's the danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT danceability, track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;
